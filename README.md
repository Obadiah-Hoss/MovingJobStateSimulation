# MovingJobStateSimulation

There's five jobs, each starting in node/state one. The jobs stay in each state for a random amount of time, between 0-100 time units, then they advance to the next state.
The clock is updated every time a job moves to a new node/state. Output is produced for the first 15 clock changes, then every 500 time units.
